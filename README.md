To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:git clone [https://github.com/shubham947222/tericsoft_assessment.git]

Navigate to the Project Directory: cd <tericsoft_assessment>

Install Dependencies: npm install

Start the Development Server: npm run dev

Once the server is running, you can access the project in your browser at http://localhost:5173 because I used Vite for fast refresh and less build time (or a different port if specified).

That's it! You've successfully set up and run the project locally.
